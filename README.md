Statistical Analysis of Biostatistics & Business Analytics Data

# Overview

This project applies chi-square testing and ANOVA to analyze patterns, relationships, and disparities in datasets related to biostatistics and business analytics. It involves hypothesis formulation, statistical testing, and result interpretation to assess data significance, group differences, and decision-making insights.

# Objectives

Perform chi-square tests to determine if observed distributions match expected distributions.

Apply one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences among multiple group means.

Analyze statistical significance using p-values, confidence intervals, and critical values.

Draw data-driven insights to support business and healthcare decision-making.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: R (Base R, Stats package)

Statistical Techniques: Chi-Square Test, One-Way ANOVA, Two-Way ANOVA

Data Processing: Data wrangling and visualization in R

Hypothesis Testing Methods: Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis, Critical Values, p-values

# Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and structured datasets for hypothesis testing.
Computed expected and observed frequencies for statistical analysis.

2. Chi-Square Testing
Conducted a chi-square test to compare blood type distributions in hospital patients against the general population.
Evaluated airline on-time performance data to determine whether airline performance matched expected trends.
Results: Found no statistically significant deviation from expected distributions (p-value > 0.05)​.

3. One-Way ANOVA
Used one-way ANOVA to compare sales performance across three market regions.
Analyzed per-pupil expenditures across different geographic sections to test for significant differences.
Results: No statistically significant variance across groups (p-value > 0.05)​.

4. Two-Way ANOVA
Examined the impact of fertilizer type and planting density on crop yields using a two-way ANOVA.
Results: Fertilizer and planting density individually affected crop yields, but their interaction was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05)​.

# Key Findings
Chi-square analysis confirmed expected distributions in medical and business datasets.
ANOVA results showed no significant differences across most tested groups, reinforcing the importance of larger sample sizes for detecting meaningful trends.
Predictive insights were drawn from statistical significance testing, enhancing business analytics and biostatistics decision-making.
