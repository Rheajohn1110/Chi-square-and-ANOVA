# Introduction: 

This project delves into the realm of statistical analysis within the
field of biostatistics and business analytics, employing chi-square and
ANOVA testing to unearth patterns, relationships, and disparities within
various datasets. Through the application of these statistical tests, we
aim to discern whether observed frequencies align with expected
distributions. Each task is approached with a structured methodology:
stating hypotheses, computing critical and test values, making decisive
conclusions, and summarizing the findings.

# Task 1 (Section 11-1 6. Blood Types)

A medical researcher wishes to see if hospital patients in a large
hospital have the same blood type distribution as those in the general
population. The distribution for the general population is as follows:

-   type A = 20%

-   type B = 28%

-   type O = 36%

-   type AB = 16%

He selects a random sample of 50 patients and finds the following:

-   12 have type A blood

-   8 have type B

-   24 have type O

-   6 have type AB blood

At α = 0.10, can it be concluded that the distribution is the same as
that of the general population?

# Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

Forming of vectors of $expected$ probabilities and $observed$
frequencies, then we run the test afterwards.

```{r}
# Observed frequencies in the hospital sample
observed1 <- c(12, 8, 24, 6)

# Expected frequencies based on the general population distribution
expected1 <- c(0.20 * 50, 0.28 * 50, 0.36 * 50, 0.16 * 50)

# alpha at 0.10
alpha1 <- 0.10

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

The hypothesis for the above will be as follow:

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of blood types in hospital
patients is the same as that of the general population.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The distribution of blood types in hospital
patients is different from that of the general population.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}

# Chi-square test
chi_square1 <- chisq.test(observed1, p = expected1 / sum(expected1))

# Print the test results
print(chi_square1)

```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   If the p-value is less than the significance level (α = 0.10), then
    we would reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-value is
    0.1404, which is greater than alpha = 0.10.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

Therefore, [based on the p-value of 0.1404, we would fail to reject the
null hypothesis.]{.underline} Hence, there is not enough evidence to
conclude that the distribution of blood types in hospital patients is
different from that of the general population at a significance level of
0.10.

# Task 2 (Section 11-1. 8. On-Time Performance by Airlines)

According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, on-time
performance by the airlines is described as follows:

| Action                                          | **% of Time** |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| On-time                                         | 70.8          |
| National Aviation System delay                  | 8.2           |
| Aircraft arriving late                          | 9.0           |
| Other (because of weather and other conditions) | 12.0          |

Records of 200 randomly selected flights for a major airline company
showed that

-   125 planes were on time

-   40 were delayed because of weather

-   10 because of a National Aviation System delay

-   25 because of arriving late

At α = 0.05, do these results differ from the government's statistics?

*Source:* www.transtats.bts.gov

### Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

Forming of vectors of \$expected\$ probabilities and \$observed\$
frequencies, then we run the test afterwards.

```{r}
# Observed frequencies
observed2 <- c(125, 10, 40, 200 - (125 + 10 + 40))

# Expected frequencies based on the given percentages
expected2 <- c(0.708 * 200, 0.082 * 200, 0.090 * 200, 0.120 * 200)

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

The hypothesis for the above will be as follow:

**Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of on-time performance categories
for the airline is consistent with the expected distribution provided by
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a significant difference in the
distribution of on-time performance categories for the airline compared
to the expected distribution provided by the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}
# to set the results to numerical digits
options(scipen = 100, digits = 10)

# Chi-square test
chi_square2 <- chisq.test(observed2, p = expected2 / sum(expected2))

# Print the test results
print(chi_square2)

options(scipen = 100, digits = 10)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   If the p-value is less than the significance level (α = 0.05), we
    would reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-value is
    0.0000007090023, which is far less than alpha = 0.05.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

[**Given that the p-value is quite low, we would reject the null
hypothesis.**]{.underline} There is strong evidence to conclude that
there is a significant difference in the distribution of on-time
performance categories for the airline compared to the expected
distribution provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at a
significance level of 0.05.

# Task 3 (Section 11-2.8. Ethnicity and Movie Admissions)

Are movie admissions related to ethnicity? A 2014 study indicated the
following numbers of admissions (in thousands) for two different years.
At the 0.05 significance level, can it be concluded that movie
attendance by year depended on ethnicity?

|      | **Caucasian** | **Hispanic** | **African American** | **Other** |
|------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| 2013 | 724           | 335          | 174                  | 107       |
| 2014 | 370           | 292          | 152                  | 140       |

*Source: MPAA Study*.

# Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

```{r}
# Create vectors for the observed frequencies
observed2013 <- c(724, 335, 174, 107)
observed2014 <- c(370, 292, 152, 140)

# Combine the vectors into a matrix
movie_matrix <- rbind(observed2013, observed2014)

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

**Null Hypothesis**: There is no association between movie attendance
and ethnicity. In other words, movie attendance is independent of
ethnicity.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a significant association between
movie attendance and ethnicity. Movie attendance is not independent of
ethnicity.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}

# Perform chi-square test for independence
chi_square3 <- chisq.test(movie_matrix)

# Print the test results
print(chi_square3)

```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   If the p-value is less than the significance level (α = 0.05), then
    we would reject the null hypothesis. Here, the p-value is
    0.0000000000005477507, which is less than alpha = 0.05.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

A matrix was constructed as part of the process because the chi-square
test for independence required it. The layout of a contingency table is
useful for arranging and examining the data when dealing with two
variables.

Therefore, [**given that the p-value is quite low, we would reject the
null hypothesis**]{.underline}. There is strong evidence to conclude
that movie attendance depends on ethnicity at a significance level of
0.05.

# Task 4 (Section11-2.10 Women in the Military)

This table lists the numbers of officers and enlisted personnel for
women in the military. At *α* = 0.05, is there sufficient evidence to
conclude that a relationship exists between rank and branch of the Armed
Forces?

![](images/Screenshot%202024-01-19%20at%209.33.59%20PM.png){width="348"}

*Source:* *New York Times Almanac*.

### Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

```{r}

# Observed frequencies
army <- c(10791, 62491)
navy <- c(7816, 42750)
marine_corp <- c(932, 9525)
air_force <- c(11819, 54344)

# Combine the vectors into a matrix
military_matrix <- rbind(army, navy, marine_corp, air_force)

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

**Null Hypothesis**: There is no relationship between the rank (officers
or enlisted) and the branch of the Armed Forces for women. In other
words, the distribution of officers and enlisted personnel is
independent of the branch.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a relationship between the rank
(officers or enlisted) and the branch of the Armed Forces for women. The
distribution of officers and enlisted personnel is not independent of
the branch.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}
# Perform chi-square test for independence
chi_square4 <- chisq.test(military_matrix)

# Print the test results
print(chi_square4)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   The p-value associated with the chi-square test statistic is less
    than alpha=0.05, which is extremely small. Since this p-value is
    significantly less than the common alpha level of 0.05, it suggests
    that we would reject the null hypothesis.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

Therefore, [**considering the small p-value, we would reject the null
hypothesis.**]{.underline} There is strong evidence to conclude that
there is a significant relationship between the rank (officers or
enlisted) and the branch of the Armed Forces for women. This suggests
that the proportions of officers and enlisted personnel are different
across vatious branches, indicating dependence between rank and branch
in the military for women.

# Task 5 (Section 12-1.8 Sodium Contents of Foods)

Perform a complete one-way ANOVA. If the null hypothesis is rejected,
use either the Scheffé or Tukeytest to see if there is a significant
difference in the pairs of means. Assume all assumptions are met.

The amount of sodium (in milligrams) in one serving for a random sample
of three different kinds of foodsis listed. At the 0.05 significance
level, is there sufficient evidence to conclude that a difference in
mean sodium amounts exists among condiments, cereals, and desserts?

| Condiments | Cereals | Desserts |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 270        | 260     | 100      |
| 130        | 220     | 180      |
| 230        | 290     | 250      |
| 180        | 290     | 250      |
| 80         | 200     | 300      |
| 70         | 320     | 360      |
| 200        | 140     | 300      |
|            |         | 160      |

: Source: The Doctor's Pocket Calorie, Fat, and Carbohydrate Counter

### Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

```{r}

# Sodium amounts for three different kinds of foods
condiments <- c(270,130,230,180,80,70,200)
cereals    <- c(260,220,290,290,200,320,140)
desserts   <- c(100,180,250,250,300,360,300,160)

task_5 <- matrix(c(rep("Condiments", 7), rep("Cereals", 7), rep("Desserts", 8), condiments , 
                  cereals, desserts),ncol=2)

df_task_5 <- data.frame(task_5)

names(df_task_5) <- c('food_type', 'sodium_milligrams')

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

**Null Hypothesis**: The population means for sodium are equal across
all three categories.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a significant difference in the
mean sodium amounts among condiments, cereals, and desserts. At least
one population mean is different from the others.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}
# Perform one-way ANOVA
aov_task_5 <- aov(as.numeric(sodium_milligrams)~food_type, data=df_task_5)

# Print the ANOVA summary
summary(aov_task_5)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   The p-value associated with the F-statistic tests the null
    hypothesis that there is no difference in means among the groups.
    Given the p-value for "food_type" is 0.11781, which is greater than
    0.05, [**we do not have enough evidence to reject the Null
    Hypothesis.**]{.underline}

### Step 5 - Conclusion

At a 0.05 significance level, there is not enough evidence to conclude
that a difference in mean sodium amounts exists among condiments,
cereals, and desserts hence we will not reject the null Hypothesis.

# Task 6 (Section 12-2.10 Sales for Leading Companies)

Perform a complete one-way ANOVA. If the null hypothesis is rejected,
use either the Scheffé or Tukeytest to see if there is a significant
difference in the pairs of means. Assume all assumptions are met.

The sales in millions of dollars for a year of a sample of leading
companies are shown. At α = 0.01, isthere a significant difference in
the means?

|            |                     |            |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Cereal** | **Chocolate Candy** | **Coffee** |
| 578        | 311                 | 261        |
| 320        | 106                 | 185        |
| 264        | 109                 | 302        |
| 249        | 125                 | 689        |
| 237        | 173                 |            |

: Source: Information Resources, Inc.

### Solution

## $\chi^2$ Test

```{r}

# Sales data for different products
cereal  <- c(578, 320, 264, 249,237)
candy   <- c(311, 106, 109, 125,173)
coffee  <- c(261, 185, 302,689)


task_6 <- matrix(c(rep("Cereal", 5), rep("Candy", 5), rep("Coffee", 4), cereal , 
                  candy, coffee),ncol=2)

df_task_6 <- data.frame(task_6)

names(df_task_6) <- c('Sample_Type', 'Sales_in_million_dollars')

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

**Null Hypothesis**: The population means for sales are equal across all
four product categories.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a significant difference in the
mean sales among chocolate, cereal, candy, and coffee. At least one
population mean is different from the others.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}
# Perform one-way ANOVA
aov_task_6 <- aov(as.numeric(Sales_in_million_dollars)~Sample_Type, data=df_task_6)

# Print the ANOVA summary
summary(aov_task_6)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   The p-value associated with the F-statistic tests the null
    hypothesis that there is no difference in means among the groups.
    Given, p-value (0.16035) is greater than the significance level =
    0.01, [**we would not reject the null hypothesis.**]{.underline}

### Step 5 - Conclusion

Therefore, at a 0.01 significance level, there is not sufficient
evidence to conclude that a significant difference in mean sales exists
among chocolate, cereal, and candy. The null hypothesis that all
population means are equal is not rejected.

# Task 7 (Section 12-2.12 Per-Pupil Expenditures)

Perform a complete one-way ANOVA. If the null hypothesis is rejected,
use either the Scheffé or Tukeytest to see if there is a significant
difference in the pairs of means. Assume all assumptions are met.

The expenditures (in dollars) per pupil for states in three sections of
the country are listed. Using α =0.05, can you conclude that there is a
difference in means?

| Eastern Third | Middle Third | Western Third |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 4946          | 6149         | 5282          |
| 5953          | 7451         | 8605          |
| 6202          | 6000         | 6528          |
| 7243          | 6479         | 6911          |
| 6113          |              |               |

: Source: New York Times Almanac

```{r}

# Expenditure data for different pupil in three section of the country
Eastern_Third  <- c(4946, 5953, 6202, 7243, 6113)
Middle_Third   <- c(6149, 7451, 6000, 6479)
Western_Third  <- c(5282, 8605, 6528, 6911)


task_7_matrix <- matrix(c(rep("Eastern_Third", 5), rep("Middle_Third", 4), rep("Western_Third", 4), Eastern_Third , Middle_Third
                  , Western_Third),ncol=2)

task_7_df <- data.frame(task_7_matrix)

names(task_7_df) <- c('Type', 'Sales_in_million_dollars')
```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

**Null Hypothesis** = There is no significant difference in the mean
expenditures per pupil among the Eastern Third, Middle Third, and
Western Third sections of the country.

**Alternative Hypothesis** = There is a significant difference in the
mean expenditure among all three sections. At least one population mean
is different from the others.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

When using the p-value for analysis, no critical value is needed.

### Step 3. Computing the test results

```{r}

# Perform one-way ANOVA
anova_result_7 <- aov(as.numeric(Sales_in_million_dollars)~Type, data=task_7_df)

# Print the ANOVA summary
summary(anova_result_7)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

-   The analysis from the one-way ANOVA suggests that the differences in
    sales across the various types are not statistically significant, as
    the p-value is greater than the conventional threshold of 0.05. This
    means that, based on the data provided, we cannot conclude that
    different types have different average sales figures; any observed
    differences could likely be due to random variation.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

Since the p-value (0.54333) is much greater than the common alpha level
of 0.05, [**we do not have enough evidence to reject the null
hypothesis.**]{.underline} Which means, there is no statistically
significant difference in the sales in million dollars across the
different types being studied. This suggests that the variations in
sales observed in the data could be due to random chance rather than
differences in the types.

# Task 8 (Section 12- 3. 10. Increasing Plant Growth)

Assume that all variables are normally or approximately normally
distributed, that the samples are\
independent, and that the population variances are equal.

a\. State the hypotheses.\
b. Find the critical value for each F-test.\
c. Complete the summary table and find the test value.\
d. Make the decision.\
e. Summarize the results. (Draw a graph of the cell means if
necessary.)\
A gardening company is testing new ways to improve plant growth. Twelve
plants are randomly\
selected and exposed to a combination of two factors:\
• a “Grow-light” in two different strengths.\
• a plant food supplement with different mineral supplements.\
After several days, the plants are measured for growth, and the results
(in inches) are put into the\
appropriate boxes.\

|              | Grow-light 1   | Grow-light 2  |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Plant food A | 9.2, 9.4, 8.9  | 8.5, 9.2, 8.9 |
| Plant food B | 7.1, 7.2, 8.5  | 5.5, 5.8, 7.6 |

Can an interaction between the two factors be concluded? Is there a
difference in mean growth with\
respect to light? With respect to plant food? Use α = 0.05.

```{r}
grow_light1 <- c(9.2, 9.4, 8.9, 7.1, 7.2, 8.5)
grow_light2 <- c(8.5, 9.2, 8.9, 5.5, 5.8, 7.6)

plant_food <- factor(rep(c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B"), 2))
grow_light <- factor(rep(c("1", "2"), each=6))

```

Combining the vectors into a data frame, with plant growth as the
response variable and plant food and grow-light as the explanatory
variables.

```{r}
task_8_df <- data.frame(growth = c(grow_light1, grow_light2), plant_food, grow_light)

```

### Step 1. Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

-   **Null Hypothesis**: There is no difference in mean plant growth
    with respect to different plant foods. All plant foods result in the
    same average plant growth.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a difference in mean plant
    growth with respect to different plant foods. At least one plant
    food results in a different average plant growth than others.

### Step 2. Finding the critical value

```{r}
critical_value_plant_food = qf(0.95, 1, 8)
critical_value_grow_light = qf(0.95, 1, 8)
critical_value_interaction = qf(0.95, 1, 8) #-(OpenAI,2024)


# Display the critical values
critical_value_plant_food
critical_value_grow_light
critical_value_interaction
```

### Step 3. Computing the test results

Using the aov function to perform the two-way ANOVA with interaction.

```{r}
task_8_result <- aov(growth ~ plant_food * grow_light, data = task_8_df)

summary(task_8_result)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

1.  Plant Food: The p-value for plant food is much less than the alpha
    level of 0.05. Since the F value for plant food is greater than the
    critical value (5.3176555072), we reject the null hypothesis for
    plant food. This indicates that the type of plant food does have a
    significant effect on plant growth.
2.  Grow Light: The p-value for grow light is greater than 0.05. Since
    the F value for grow light is less than the critical value, we fail
    to reject the null hypothesis for grow light. This indicates that
    there is no significant effect of grow light strength on plant
    growth at the 5% significance level.
3.  Interaction between Plant Food and Grow Light: The p-value for the
    interaction is greater than 0.05, indicating no statistically
    significant interaction effect between plant food and grow light on
    plant growth. The F value for the interaction is also less than the
    critical value, supporting the decision to fail to reject the null
    hypothesis for the interaction effect.

### Step 5 - Conclusion

In conclusion, [**the type of plant food significantly affects plant
growth**]{.underline}, while the strength of grow light and the
[**interaction between plant food and grow light do not have a
significant effect on plant growth**]{.underline}.

2. Perform EDA on the imported data set. Write a paragraph or two to
describe the data set using\
descriptive statistics and plots. Are there any trends or anything of
interest to discuss?\
3. Assuming the expected frequencies are equal, perform a Chi-Square
Goodness-of-Fit test to\
determine if there is a difference in the number of wins by decade. Be
sure to include the\
following:\
a. State the hypotheses and identify the claim.\
b. Find the critical value (\
α = 0.05) (programmatically).\
c. Compute the test value.\
d. Make the decision. Clearly state if the null hypothesis should or
should not be rejected\
and why.\
e. Does comparing the critical and test values provide the same result
as comparing the p-\
value from R with the significance level?\

Here is some code to get you started. Be sure to import the dplyr and
tidyverse packages.\
\# Extract decade from year\
bb\$Decade \<- bb\$Year - (bb\$Year %% 10)\
\# Create a wins table by summing the wins by decade\
wins \<- bb %\>%\
group_by(Decade) %\>%

summarize(wins = sum(W)) %\>%\
as.tibble()\

4\. Download the file ‘crop_data.csv’ from the course resources and
import the file into R.\
5. Perform a Two-way ANOVA test using yield as the dependent variable
and fertilizer and density\
as the independent variables. Explain the results of the test. Is there
reason to believe that\
fertilizer and density impact yield?\
\*\* Be sure to convert the variables density and fertilizer to R
factors.\
\*\* Include a null and alternate hypothesis for both factors and the
interaction

### 9.1 Import Data

```{r}
# Loading necessary packages
library(tidyverse)

library(dplyr)

# Import the data
baseball <- read.csv('baseball-3.csv')

```

Cleaning the dataset.

```{r}

# Impute missing values in numeric variables with mean
numeric_cols <- sapply(baseball, is.numeric)
baseball[, numeric_cols] <- lapply(baseball[, numeric_cols], function(x) {
  if(any(is.na(x))) {
    x <- replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  }
  x
})
```

### 9.2 Performing basic EDA

```{r}
str(baseball)
```

```{r}
int_columns<- sapply(baseball, is.integer)

baseball[, int_columns]<- lapply(baseball[int_columns], as.numeric)

str(baseball)
```

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
 #Calculating correlation matrix

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Selecting only numeric columns for correlation
numeric_columns <- baseball %>% select_if(is.numeric)

# Calculating correlation matrix with numeric columns only
correlation_table <- cor(numeric_columns, use = "complete.obs")

# Displaying correlation matrix using kable
kable(correlation_table, format = "markdown")



```

```{r}

corrplot(correlation_table, 
         method = "color",
         type = "upper",
         order = "hclust",
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         tl.cex = 0.5,
         addrect = 1,
         title= "Plot 1- Correlation Matrix", cex.main=1)

```

**Interpretation of Plot 1 -**

The above correlation heatmap illustrates the correlation between
different variables of baseball dataset. Below is a brief understaniding
of the heatmap:

-   **Dark Blue**: Indicates a strong positive correlation, meaning as
    one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.

-   **Dark Red**: Indicates a strong negative correlation, meaning as
    one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

-   **Light Colors**: Indicate weaker correlations, with lighter blues
    for weaker positive correlations and lighter reds for weaker
    negative correlations.

-   **White**: Indicates no correlation, meaning there's no linear
    relationship between those two variables.

    Further,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Wins (W)** and **Playoffs**: There might be a strong positive
    correlation between the number of wins and making it to the
    playoffs, which is expected as teams with more wins are more likely
    to qualify for the playoffs.

-   **Runs Allowed (RA)** and **RankSeason**: There could be a
    noticeable negative correlation, suggesting that allowing fewer runs
    might be associated with a higher season ranking.

-   **On-base Plus Slugging (OPS)**, **On-base Percentage (OBP)**, and
    **Slugging Percentage (SLG)**: These offensive statistics are likely
    to show strong positive correlations with each other, as they are
    all measures of a player's or team's batting performance.

```{r}

# Histogram for Runs Scored (RS)
ggplot(data = baseball, aes(x = RS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Plot 2 - Histogram of Runs Scored", x = "Runs Scored", y = "Frequency")
```

**Interpretation of Plot 2-**

-   The histogram illustrates the distribution of runs scored by
    baseball teams.

-   The x-axis specifies the number of runs scored, while the y-axis
    indicates the frequency of teams scoring within various run
    intervals.

-   The data is distributed across a wide range of values, suggesting
    variability in offensive performance among the teams.

-   The distribution appears to be bimodal, with two peaks indicating
    that there are two different 'typical' values of runs scored that
    are more common than others.

```{r}
# Histogram for Wins (W)
ggplot(data = baseball, aes(x = W)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Plot 3 - Histogram of Wins", x = "Wins", y = "Frequency")
```

I**nterpretation of Plot 3 - Histogram of Wins:**

-   In this histogram, the x-axis represents the number of wins, and the
    y-axis represents the frequency of teams that fall into each range
    of wins. The bars show the number of teams that have won a certain
    number of games within specific intervals.

-   The distribution seems to be roughly symmetric and bell-shaped,
    implying a normal-like distribution of wins among the teams.

-   Teams with significantly fewer than 70 or more than 90 wins are less
    frequent, as shown by the shorter bars at the two tails of the
    histogram.

```{r}

# Assuming the baseball dataset is loaded in a dataframe called baseball
mean_RS <- mean(baseball$RS, na.rm = TRUE)
median_RA <- median(baseball$RA, na.rm = TRUE)

# Output the results
print(paste("Mean Runs Scored (RS):", mean_RS))
print(paste("Median Runs Allowed (RA):", median_RA))
```

The mean RS could provide insight into the average offensive power of
teams, while the median RA could give a sense of what a typical team's
defensive performance might be.

```{r}

# Calculate the correlation between Runs Scored and Wins
correlation_rs_w <- cor(baseball$RS, baseball$W, use = "complete.obs")

# Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship
plot(baseball$RS, baseball$W, main = "Plot 4 - Scatter Plot of Runs Scored vs. Wins",
     xlab = "Runs Scored (RS)", ylab = "Games Won (W)", pch = 19)

# Add a regression line to the scatter plot
abline(lm(W ~ RS, data = baseball), col = "blue") #-(OpenAI,2024)

# Output the correlation coefficient
print(paste("Correlation coefficient between Runs Scored and Wins:", correlation_rs_w))
```

**Interpretation of Plot 4 -**

-   The scatter plot depicts the relationship between Runs Scored (RS)
    and Games Won (W) in a baseball game.

-   Each point on the plot represents a team, with its position
    determined by how many runs they scored in the season and how many
    games they won.

-   There is a visible upward trend indicated by the points, suggesting
    a positive relationship between these two variables: as the number
    of runs scored increases, so generally does the number of games won.

-   The linear regression line further highlights this positive
    correlation, showing the best fit for the data points.

### 9.3 Perform a Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test to determine if there is a difference in the number of wins by decade

```{r}

library(tibble)
# Extract decade from year
baseball$Decade <- baseball$Year - (baseball$Year %% 10)

# Create a wins table by summing the wins by decade
wins <- baseball %>%
group_by(Decade) %>%
summarize(wins = sum(W)) %>%
as.tibble()

no_of_decades <- length(unique(baseball$Decade))

# Expected proportions for each decade
expected_win <- rep(1/no_of_decades, no_of_decades) #- (OpenAI,2024)
```

### Step 1 - State the hypothesis and identify the claim

-   **Null hypothesis** : There is no difference in the number of wins
    by decade.
-   **Alternative hypothesis** : There is a difference in the number of
    wins by decade.

### Step 2 - Calculate critical value at alpha = 0.05

```{r}

critical_value <- qchisq(p = 0.95, df = length(wins$wins) - 1)

cat("Critical value at alpha = 0.05 = ",critical_value)
```

### Step 3 - Compute test value

```{r}
chisq_test_9<- chisq.test(x = wins$wins, p = expected_win)

test_9 <- chisq_test_9$statistic
chisq_test_9
cat("Test value = ", test_9)
```

### Step 4 - Analyzing the results

***Hypothesis Rule:*** If the p-value is less than alpha, we must reject
the Null Hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we do not
have enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis.

**Interpretation:**

In this case, the p-value is extremely small i.e 0.00000000000000022204
[**hence we will reject the Null Hypothesis.**]{.underline}

Also, in this case, the test value is greater than the critical value
i.e 9989.536\>11.07 so we will reject the Null Hypothesis.

### Step 5 - Does comparing the critical and test values provide the same result as comparing the p-value from R with the significance level?

Yes. While comparing both the outcomes and hypothesis rule for p-value
and test-value, it is observed in this case that both support rejection
of Null Hypothesis.

### 9.4 Download and import the dataset 'crop_data.csv'

```{r}
 crop_data<- read.csv("crop_data-3.csv")
 
```

### 9.5 Perform Two-way ANOVA

```{r}
# Converting 'density' and 'fertilizer' to factors
crop_data$density <- as.factor(crop_data$density)
crop_data$fertilizer <- as.factor(crop_data$fertilizer)

# Performing Two-way ANOVA
aov_9 <- aov(yield ~ density * fertilizer, data = crop_data)

# Display the ANOVA table
summary(aov_9)
```

### 9.5.1 Stating the hypotheses and identify the claim

1.  For 'density':

    -   Null Hypothesis: There is no effect of density on the yield i.e.
        all levels of density produce the same yield on average.

    -   Alternative Hypothesis: There is an effect of density on the
        yield i.e. at least one level of density produces a yield that
        is different from the others.

2.  For 'fertilizer':

    -   Null Hypothesis: There is no effect of fertilizer on the yield.

    -   Alternative Hypothesis: There is an effect of fertilizer on the
        yield.

3.  For 'density' and 'fertilizer' interaction:

    -   Null Hypothesis: There is no interaction effect between density
        and fertilizer on the yield.

    -   Alternative Hypothesis: There is an interaction effect between
        density and fertilizer on the yield.

### 9.5.2 Analysis:

1.  Density: The p-value for density is less than 0.05 i.e. 0.000186 \<
    0.05. Therefore, [**we reject the null hypothesis**]{.underline} and
    support the alternate hypothesis which means that at least one level
    of density produces a yield that is different from the others.
2.  Fertilizer: The p-value for fertilizer is less than 0.05 i.e.
    0.000273 \< 0.05. Therefore, [**we reject the null
    hypothesis**]{.underline} and support the alternate hypothesis which
    means that at least one type of fertilizer results in a different
    average yield than the others.
3.  Density Fertilizer interaction: the p-value is greater than 0.05
    i.e. 0.532500 \> 0.05. Therefore, [**we do not have enough evidence
    to reject the Null Hypothesis**]{.underline}. Which means, that the
    effect of one factor does not depend on the level of the other
    factor.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, both Density and Fertilizer have respective effects on
the yield but their interdependence is not very significant.

# Overall assignment conclusion:

The chi-square tests offered a lens through which we examined
distributional assumptions against empirical data, revealing both
consistencies and anomalies in patterns of blood types, airline
punctuality, and movie attendance. The one-way and two-way ANOVAs shed
light on the significance of group differences, highlighting the impact
of various factors on sales, sodium content, and plant growth.
